SOLID Ruby
----------
The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that improve an Object Oriented design.  They are:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open/Closed Princip
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

The SOLID principles were written with a statically typed language (such as C++ or Java) in mind.  What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby?  This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, and how to create well designed Ruby software.
